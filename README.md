This project is made for a company as a [test task](https://github.com/coingaming/elixir-test) ([a copy](task_description.md)).

The solution hasn't been sent so it can be incorrect.

Some decisions:

- typespecs are not used for simplicity
- supervisors are not used for simplicity
- doctests are not used for simplicity
- transactions are not saved for simplicity
- `delay` parameter is added to test performance. I didn't find a better way (probably could test different parts in isolation)
